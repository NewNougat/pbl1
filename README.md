#React Challenge Number 1
Problem:

You are tasked with creating a ListFilter component in React. The component should display a list of numbers and provide filtering options for the user to display only even numbers, odd numbers, or all numbers.

Your task is to:

Create a ListFilter component that takes a list of numbers as a prop and displays them.
Implement filtering functionality that allows the user to toggle between displaying all numbers, only even numbers, or only odd numbers.
Ensure that the filtering options update the displayed list in real-time.
Requirements:

The ListFilter component should take a prop named numbers which is an array of integers to display.
The component should have three buttons: "All", "Even", and "Odd".
Clicking the "All" button should display all numbers.
Clicking the "Even" button should display only the even numbers from the list.
Clicking the "Odd" button should display only the odd numbers from the list.
Bonus:

Add styling to the ListFilter component to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
Provide feedback to the user indicating which filtering option is currently active.
This challenge will help you practice creating dynamic and reusable components in React, especially focusing on handling different options and updating the UI accordingly. Good luck!
